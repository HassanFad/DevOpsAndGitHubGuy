## MVC Application using C# and ASP .NET Core

### Key Components of an MVC Application

The key components of an MVC (Model-View-Controller) application are:

* **Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for retrieving data from the database and processing it before sending it to the view.
* **View**: Represents the user interface of the application. It is responsible for displaying the data provided by the model to the user.
* **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It handles user input, updates the model, and selects the appropriate view to display the data.

In an ASP.NET Core MVC application, these components are typically organized into separate folders within the project. For example, the `Models` folder contains the model classes, the `Views` folder contains the view files, and the `Controllers` folder contains the controller classes.

### Setting Up a New ASP .NET Core Project

To set up a new ASP .NET Core project, follow these steps:

* Open a terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the directory where you want to create the new project.
* Run the following command to create a new ASP .NET Core MVC project:
  ```
  dotnet new mvc -n MyMvcApp
  ```
  Replace `MyMvcApp` with the desired name for your project.
* Navigate into the newly created project directory:
  ```
  cd MyMvcApp
  ```
* Open the project in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio).
* Restore the project dependencies by running:
  ```
  dotnet restore
  ```
* Build the project to ensure everything is set up correctly:
  ```
  dotnet build
  ```
* Run the project to start the development server:
  ```
  dotnet run
  ```
* Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see your new ASP .NET Core MVC application in action.
